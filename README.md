# Shark
ComputerCraft Program

I thought I would put this in it's own Github as it's a fairly large project with a large filesystem.

##### PLANNED FEATURES
- Configuration and Customisation
  - Startup Sharkle
  - Themes
    - Based on theme files (table files)
    - Shark Themes:
      - Shark: White and Cyan (Default)
      - Ember: Yellow and Orange
      - Void: Black and Purple
      - Leaf: White and Green
    - Users can create their own themes as well
  - Modes
    - Online Mode: Page requests can be sent/received
    - Offline Mode: Can't send/receive page requests
    - Passive Mode: Can't receive page requests but can send them
  - Certificates
    - Sites may need a certificate to access their pages

##### POTENTIAL FEATURES
- Tabs
  - Would need a complete re-write (DRAFT 5?)
  - Multiple pages open
